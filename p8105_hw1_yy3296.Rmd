## Problem 1
* import a package which includes drop_na function

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
```

* load the package "palmerpenguins" which contains the dataset "penguins"
* drop all of NA form "penguins"

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")  
penguins_drop = drop_na(penguins) 
```
* short description of the penguins dataset
  * This dataset has eight variables, which are species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. 
  * The dataset has `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. 
  * the mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins_drop$flipper_length_mm)`

* make a scatterplot and save the scatterplot as a pdf

```{r}
ggplot(penguins_drop,aes(x = bill_length_mm,y = flipper_length_mm,color=species)) + geom_point()
ggsave('scatterplot of problem1.pdf')
```
