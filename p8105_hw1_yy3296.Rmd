```

* This dataset has eight variables, which are species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. 
* The dataset has `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. 
* the mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins_drop$flipper_length_mm)`

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
